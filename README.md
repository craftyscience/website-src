# Simple Svelte App for Craft Science Website

Dan test

The Crafty Science website, which is [here](https://craftyscience.github.io/), is mostly a very simple static site and does not require even basic JS. However, the very nice framework [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is used to handle retrevial of sensor data, providing pseudo real-time updates.

To build the website into directory ```dist```:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

For development:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

and open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).
